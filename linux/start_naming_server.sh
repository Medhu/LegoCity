# When you are using the PolyORB version you need to set this environment variable
# in each of the clients.
# There is an IP adress in this string, which needs to correspond to the IP-Adress of your 
# computer where your server is running.
# 
# On the server you need to change in a file called  'polyorb.conf' 
# look for the attribute: polyorb.protocols.iiop.default_addr
# adjust this to be the IP-adress of the server.
